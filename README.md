Program finds Pi using monte-carlo method  
It also calculates runtime  
MPI library allows to parallelize processes on accessible CPU's

Example: on linux, command "mpicxx \-o mpi mpi.cpp" will compile and create executable (MPICH required)  
Command "mpiexec -n 2 ./mpi" will launch exe with 2 processes
